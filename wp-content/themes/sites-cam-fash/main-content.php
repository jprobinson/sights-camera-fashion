<?php

// The Loop
// The loop is perhaps the most powerful part of your WordPress theme. 
// It starts with a query (which determines which posts or pages to grab), and ends with a PHP "endwhile" statement. Everything in between is up to you. 
// You can specify the output of titles, post content, metadata, custom fields and commenting all within the loop and each element is output for each post or page until the query is done. 
// You can set up multiple loops and queries on a single page; for example: on a single.php you could have the loop showing the entire content of a single post, with a loop outputting just titles and thumbnails for related posts below it.
// Query post or page
// Start Loop
// the_title (outputs the title of the post)
// the_excerpt (outputs the post excerpt)
// the_content (outputs the full post content)
// the_category (outputs the post categories)
// the_author (outputs the post author)
// the_date (outputs the post date)
// other tags (there is a variety of other tags you can use in the loop)
// endwhile;
// Exit the loop
